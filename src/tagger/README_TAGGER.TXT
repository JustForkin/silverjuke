This folder contains the tagging library used in internally in Silverjuke, we 
called it "tagger".

"tagger" is based upon taglib which is available at https://taglib.github.io/ 
and https://github.com/taglib/taglib

Both, "taglib" and "tagger" libraries, are availabe under the same licences, 
LGPL or MPL.
(note, that Silverjuke itself may use different licences than this library!)
